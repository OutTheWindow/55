---

### Current Overview

- [outthewindow.art](https://www.outthewindow.art) = current site 

- [outthewindow.github.io](https://outthewindow.github.io/Site/) = draft of additional content

- Domain due renewal

- Considering selling zine online (on OTW site or seperate?)

--- 

### Considerations

- Static Site (current format)

- GitHub Pages hosted 

- [GRAV CMS](https://getgrav.org) = alt CMS for expanded functionality

- [Freethought](https://www.freethought.uk) = alt hosting option 
  
  - £20 per yr (500MB)
  
  - £35 per yr (5GB)
    
    - Also higher plans but unlikely to need it
  
  - Plus £18.20 per yer for '.art'
    
    - £18.20 one-off transfer fee
    
    - might not need transfer if expired
  
  - Or £7.50 for '.co.uk' (£5.50 2+yrs)

- Can ofc look into other options

- Useful to think about:
  
  - Private Staging Set-up
  
  - Editing Access
  
  - Ecommerce Potential
  
  - Future Scaling

### Ecommerce

##### Potential Options:

(Need to look into these further, some possibly free options but mostly small fees etc, best option would be to intergrate it into own site so more flexible and personalised. Mostly searched for what could be combined with Grav so far since that's what I'm familiar with. Could also just look into the typical pre-hosted platforms to build something seperate...)



- [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com)
  
  - Main one known to be usable with Grav
  
  - 2% of transactions + Payment gateway fees OR
  
  - Minimum 13 CAD / £7.75 per month if sales under 629 CAD / £374
  
  - So roughly £7.75pm most likely 
  
  - Can test it out for free at least

- [Ecwid](https://www.ecwid.com)
  
  - Also just as promising (or better) than Snipcart
  
  - Limited free option (5 products max?) or £14.08per month anual plan
  
  - (Guessing that's a bit too high unless selling a lot?)

- [Opencart](https://www.opencart.com)
  
  - Haven't checked properly, might be via their platform only
  
  - Also saw mention of Amazon which not keen on (cloud part??)
